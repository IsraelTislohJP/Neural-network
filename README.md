**Wine Quality Classification using Artificial Neural Network in R**

This project involves building a classification model to predict wine quality using an artificial neural network (ANN) in R.

In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to classify wine quality based on various features of the wine dataset. The key steps involved include:

Data Importation: The dataset was imported and necessary packages were loaded.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was manipulated to prepare it for model building. This included normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building: An artificial neural network was used to build the classification model.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated on the test set, achieving an accuracy of 94%.
